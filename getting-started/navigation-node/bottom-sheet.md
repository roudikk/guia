# Bottom Sheet

One of the motivations behind creating this library is allowing a bit more freedom when using bottom sheets or dialogs. Changing their behaviour in realtime and making them more stateful. That's why Guia renders the bottom sheets in a slightly altered version of a `ModalBottomSheetLayout`that has smoother transition animations between bottom sheets and allows for changing its behavior in realtime.
