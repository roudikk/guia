# Custom BackstackManager

In this section we will see how we can use the `BackstackManager` API to create custom containers for our backstack for different use cases. In this doc we will see two examples

* ViewPager
* Card Stack

You can find both examples in the [Sample app's custom feature.](https://github.com/roudikk/compose-navigator/tree/rkk/playground-bs/sample/feature-custom)
