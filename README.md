# Overview

Guia is a simple Navigation Library for Jetpack Compose.

The motivation behind creating this library is to provide a simple, yet customizable API, for building multi module android navigation system with support for screens, dialogs, bottom sheets or any other representation of a UI.

Guia also has proper android Lifecycle, ViewModel and saved state support.



The name "Guia" means Guidance. Very original, I know. Naming things is hard.
